## Session protocol

Every session MUST follow this two-step pattern:

**Step 1 — write this as the VERY FIRST tool call when work starts:**
```
| DEVOPS-XXX | planning | 2026-01-01 14:30 | OPEN | — | Session started |
```

**Step 2 — update to this as the VERY LAST tool call before declaring session complete:**
```
| DEVOPS-XXX | planning | 2026-01-01 14:30 | 2026-01-01 14:52 | 22m | Description of what was done |
```

Duration = end minus start in minutes. Never estimate or guess.
If the OPEN entry is missing, ask the user for the actual start time before closing.
Never log to Jira until the entry is finalized (no OPEN or — remaining).
